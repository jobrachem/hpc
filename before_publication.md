# Before Publication

1. Archive jobs that are irrelevant to publication and remove them from the repository before publishing.
2. If necessary, add specific comments to `README.md` to help researchers reproduce your results or adjust the existing instructions to reflect any additions or changes to the default repository design.
3. Test the relevant jobs: Do they run without error? This is absolutely essential.
4. Test the analysis scripts: Do they run without error in a fresh environment? This, too, is absolutely essential.
