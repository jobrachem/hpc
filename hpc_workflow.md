# Workflow for Experimentation using a High Performance Compute Cluster

This assumes that setup has been completed successfully.

1. Write code locally
2. Test code locally
3. Test submission to HPC
4. Submit full jobs to HPC
5. Download data
6. Gather data
7. Analyse data

Generally, Steps 1-7 will be repeated until experimentation is finished. Only then you continue with Step 8.

8. Archive and curate experiments.
9. Publish curated experiments, data, and analysis.
